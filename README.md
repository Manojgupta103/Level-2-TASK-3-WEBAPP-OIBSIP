# Basic To-Do Web App

This README file provides an overview of the Basic To-Do Web App project, which is designed and developed using web development and design principles. This project serves as a simple yet functional to-do list application.

## Project Overview

The Basic To-Do Web App is a web-based application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks or to-do lists. This project focuses on fundamental web development and design concepts to create a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.


**Explore the Files**:
   - `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web application.
   - `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling and layout.
   - `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity and functionality to the app.


## Project Structure

The Basic To-Do Web App is organized as follows:

- **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file contains the HTML structure of the web app. It defines the layout and elements such as input fields, task lists, and buttons.

- **CSS Styling**: The `style.css` file is used for styling the web app, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: The `script.js` file contains JavaScript code responsible for adding functionality to the app, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.

- **Images and Icons**: The `images/` directory, if present, contains any images or icons used in the app. Make sure to keep these resources organized and appropriately named.

## Design Considerations

Here are some design considerations for the Basic To-Do Web App:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to use, even for those unfamiliar with the app.

- **Responsive Design**: Make the web app responsive, so it works well on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

- **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility guidelines to ensure that the app can be used by people with disabilities.

- **Clean and Organized Code**: Maintain clean, well-structured, and commented code to make it easy for others to understand and contribute.

- **Data Persistence**: Implement data storage mechanisms, such as local storage or server-based databases, to save and retrieve tasks across sessions.
